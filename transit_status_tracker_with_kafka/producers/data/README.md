### Simulation Datasets

The data in this directory is used as the seed data that simulator uses to generate event data.

Much of the data in this directory is derived from the (City of Chicago Transit Authority's open
datasets](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/). Thank you to the City of Chicago for providing
this data! Specifically, the following datasets originate from this source:

* [`cta_stations.csv`](cta_stations.csv)
* [`ridership_seed.csv`](ridership_seed.csv)

The data from these sources has been truncated and some columns were added to make the simulation
more useful.
