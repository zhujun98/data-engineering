# Evaluate Human Balance with Spark Streaming

Jun Zhu
___

You work for the data science team at STEDI, a small startup focused on 
assessing balance for seniors. STEDI has an application that collects data 
from seniors during a small exercise. The user logs in, and then selects the 
customer they are working with. Then the user starts a timer, and clicks a 
button with each step the senior takes. When the senior has reached 30 steps, 
their test is finished. The data transmitted enables the application to monitor 
seniorsâ€™ balance risk. 

## Start the Spark ecosystem with Kafka and Redis

```
docker-compose up
```

Check the Kafka topics by
```sh
docker exec broker kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
```
If all the services started correctly, you should be able to see the following
list of topics:
```
__confluent.support.metrics
__consumer_offsets
atm-visits
atm-withdrawals
balance-updates
bank-customers
bank-deposits
bank-withdrawals
check-in
fuel-level
gear-position
redis-server
vehicle-status
your-topic-here
```

- Log in to the STEDI application: http://localhost:4567

- Click Create New Customer, create a test customer and submit

- Click start, then add steps until you reach 30 and the timer has stopped

- Repeat this three times, and you will receive a risk score

## Analyzing the Data

The STEDI data science team has configured some real-time data sources using 
Kafka Connect. One of those data sources is Redis. When a customer is first 
assessed in the STEDI application, their record is added to a sorted set 
called Customer in redis. Redis is running in a docker container on the default 
redis port (6379). There is no redis password configured. Redis is configured 
as a Kafka source, and whenever any data is saved to Redis (including Customer 
information), a payload is published to the Kafka topic called redis-server. 

- To connect to the redis instance, from the terminal connect to Redis: 

```
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```

The following keys are already in Redis:
```
127.0.0.1:6379> keys **
1) "Customer"
2) "Payment"
3) "User"
4) "Reservation"
5) "CustomerLocation"
```

- In another terminal run this command to start monitoring the kafka topic:

```
docker exec -it broker kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic redis-server
```

In the kafka consumer terminal you will see the following payload appear in the redis-server topic:

```json
{"key":"Q3VzdG9tZXI=","existType":"NONE","ch":false,"incr":false,"zSetEntries":[{"element":"eyJjdXN0b21lck5hbWUiOiJTYW0gVGVzdCIsImVtYWlsIjoic2FtLnRlc3RAdGVzdC5jb20iLCJwaG9uZSI6IjgwMTU1NTEyMTIiLCJiaXJ0aERheSI6IjIwMDEtMDEtMDMifQ==","score":0.0}],"zsetEntries":[{"element":"eyJjdXN0b21lck5hbWUiOiJTYW0gVGVzdCIsImVtYWlsIjoic2FtLnRlc3RAdGVzdC5jb20iLCJwaG9uZSI6IjgwMTU1NTEyMTIiLCJiaXJ0aERheSI6IjIwMDEtMDEtMDMifQ==","score":0.0}]}
```

Formatted version of the payload:
```json
{"key":"__Q3VzdG9tZXI=__",
"existType":"NONE",
"Ch":false,
"Incr":false,
"zSetEntries":[{
"element":"__eyJjdXN0b21lck5hbWUiOiJTYW0gVGVzdCIsImVtYWlsIjoic2FtLnRlc3RAdGVzdC5jb20iLCJwaG9uZSI6IjgwMTU1NTEyMTIiLCJiaXJ0aERheSI6IjIwMDEtMDEtMDMifQ==__",
"Score":0.0
}],
"zsetEntries":[{
"element":"eyJjdXN0b21lck5hbWUiOiJTYW0gVGVzdCIsImVtYWlsIjoic2FtLnRlc3RAdGVzdC5jb20iLCJwaG9uZSI6IjgwMTU1NTEyMTIiLCJiaXJ0aERheSI6IjIwMDEtMDEtMDMifQ==",
"score":0.0
}]
}
```

Both the key and the zSetEntries fields contain data that is base64 encoded. If you base64 decoded the above encoded data it would look like this:

```json
{"key":"__Customer__",
"existType":"NONE",
"Ch":false,
"Incr":false,
"zSetEntries":[{
"element":"__{"customerName":"Sam Test","email":"sam.test@test.com","phone":"8015551212","birthDay":"2001-01-03"}",
"Score":0.0
}__],
"zsetEntries":[{
"element":"{"customerName":"Sam Test","email":"sam.test@test.com","phone":"8015551212","birthDay":"2001-01-03"}",
"score":0.0
}]
}
```

## The Challenge

The application development team has programmed certain business events to be 
published automatically to Kafka. Whenever a customer takes an assessment, 
their risk score is generated, as long as they have four or more completed 
assessments. The risk score is transmitted to a Kafka topic called 
`stedi-events`. The `stedi-events` Kafka topic has a String key and a String 
value as a JSON object with this format:

```json
{
  "customer":"Jason.Mitra@test.com",
  "score":7.0,
  "riskDate":"2020-09-14T07:54:06.417Z"
}
```

The application development team was not able to complete the feature as the 
graph is currently not receiving any data. Because the graph is currently not 
receiving any data, you need to generate a new payload in a Kafka topic and 
make it available to the STEDI application to consume:

![Empty Graph](images/empty_graph.png)

- Spark master and worker run as part of the docker-compose configuration

- Save the Spark startup logs for submission with your solution using the commands below:

```
docker logs spark-master >& ../../spark/logs/spark-master.log

docker logs spark-worker >& ../../spark/logs/spark-master.log >& ../../spark/logs/spark-worker.log
```

- Create a new Kafka topic to transmit the complete risk score with birth date, 
so the data can be viewed in the STEDI application graph

- Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and set the name of the newly created topic:

```
KAFKA_RISK_TOPIC: ______
```

- From the terminal running the docker-composer output, stop the docker containers:
```
CTRL+C
```

- Wait until they all stop

- Start the docker containers once again:

```
docker-compose up
```

- Log in to the STEDI application: http://localhost:4567

- From the timer page, use the toggle button in the upper right corner to 
- activate simulated user data to see real-time customer and risk score data. Toggle off and on to create additional customers for redis events. Each time you activate it, STEDI creates 30 new customers, and then starts generating risk scores for each one. It takes 4 minutes for each customer to have risk scores generated, however customer data is generated immediately.

- To monitor the progress of data generated, from a terminal type: 

```
docker logs -f nd029-c2-apache-spark-and-spark-streaming_stedi_1
```



You are going to write 3 Spark Python scripts. Each will connect to a kafka 
broker running at `kafka:19092` :
  - `redis-server` topic: Write one spark script `sparkpyrediskafkastreamtoconsole.py` 
to subscribe to the `redis-server` topic, base64 decode the payload, and deserialize the JSON to individual fields, then print the fields to the console. The data should include the birth date and email address. You will need these.
  - `stedi-events` topic: Write a second spark script `sparkpyeventskafkastreamtoconsole.py` to subscribe to the `stedi-events` topic and deserialize the JSON (it is not base64 encoded) to individual fields. You will need the email address and the risk score.
  - New Topic: Write a spark script `sparkpykafkajoin.py` to join the customer dataframe and the customer risk dataframes, joining on the email address. Create a JSON output to the newly created kafka topic you configured for STEDI to subscribe to that contains at least the fields below:

```json
{"customer":"Santosh.Fibonnaci@test.com",
 "score":"28.5",
 "email":"Santosh.Fibonnaci@test.com",
 "birthYear":"1963"
} 
```

- From a new terminal type: `submit-event-kafkajoin.sh` or `submit-event-kafkajoin.cmd` to submit to the cluster

- Once the data is populated in the configured kafka topic, the graph should have real-time data points

- Upload at least two screenshots of the working graph to the screenshots workspace folder
