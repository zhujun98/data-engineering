# Public Transit Status with Apache Kafka

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has asked us to develop a dashboard 
displaying system status for its commuters. We have decided to use Kafka 
and ecosystem tools like REST Proxy and Kafka Connect to accomplish this task.

Our architecture will look like so:

![Project Architecture](images/archetecture.png)

### Step 1: Create Kafka Producers
The first step in our plan is to configure the train stations to emit some of 
the events that we need. The CTA has placed a sensor on each side of every 
train station that can be programmed to take an action whenever a train arrives 
at the station.

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the code in `producers/models/producer.py`
1. Define a `value` schema for the arrival event in `producers/models/schemas/arrival_value.json` with the following attributes
	* `station_id`
	* `train_id`
	* `direction`
	* `line`
	* `train_status`
	* `prev_station_id`
	* `prev_direction`
1. Complete the code in `producers/models/station.py` so that:
	* A topic is created for each station in Kafka to track the arrival events
	* The station emits an `arrival` event to Kafka whenever the `Station.run()` function is called.
	* Ensure that events emitted to kafka are paired with the Avro `key` and `value` schemas
1. Define a `value` schema for the turnstile event in `producers/models/schemas/turnstile_value.json` with the following attributes
	* `station_id`
	* `station_name`
	* `line`
1. Complete the code in `producers/models/turnstile.py` so that:
	* A topic is created for each turnstile for each station in Kafka to track the turnstile events
	* The station emits a `turnstile` event to Kafka whenever the `Turnstile.run()` function is called.
	* Ensure that events emitted to kafka are paired with the Avro `key` and `value` schemas

### Step 2: Configure Kafka REST Proxy Producer
Our partners at the CTA have asked that we also send weather readings into Kafka from their weather hardware. Unfortunately, this hardware is old and we cannot use the Python Client Library due to hardware restrictions. Instead, we are going to use HTTP REST to send the data to Kafka from the hardware using Kafka's REST Proxy.

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Define a `value` schema for the weather event in `producers/models/schemas/weather_value.json` with the following attributes
	* `temperature`
	* `status`
1. Complete the code in `producers/models/weather.py` so that:
	* A topic is created for weather events
	* The weather model emits `weather` event to Kafka REST Proxy whenever the `Weather.run()` function is called.
		* **NOTE**: When sending HTTP requests to Kafka REST Proxy, be careful to include the correct `Content-Type`. Pay close attention to the [examples in the documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/kafka-rest/api.html#post--topics-(string-topic_name)) for more information.
	* Ensure that events emitted to REST Proxy are paired with the Avro `key` and `value` schemas

### Step 3: Configure Kafka Connect
Finally, we need to extract station information from our PostgreSQL database into Kafka. We've decided to use the [Kafka JDBC Source Connector](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/source-connector/index.html).

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the code and configuration in `producers/connectors.py`
	* Please refer to the [Kafka Connect JDBC Source Connector Configuration Options](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-jdbc/source-connector/source_config_options.html) for documentation on the options you must complete.
	* You can run this file directly to test your connector, rather than running the entire simulation.
	* Make sure to use the [Landoop Kafka Connect UI](http://localhost:8084) and [Landoop Kafka Topics UI](http://localhost:8085) to check the status and output of the Connector.
	* To delete a misconfigured connector: `CURL -X DELETE localhost:8083/connectors/stations`

### Step 4: Configure the Faust Stream Processor
We will leverage Faust Stream Processing to transform the raw Stations table that we ingested from Kafka Connect. The raw format from the database has more data than we need, and the line color information is not conveniently configured. To remediate this, we're going to ingest data from our Kafka Connect topic, and transform the data.

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the code and configuration in `consumers/faust_stream.py

#### Watch Out!

You must run this Faust processing application with the following command:

`faust -A faust_stream worker -l info`

### Step 5: Configure the KSQL Table
Next, we will use KSQL to aggregate turnstile data for each of our stations. Recall that when we produced turnstile data, we simply emitted an event, not a count. What would make this data more useful would be to summarize it by station so that downstream applications always have an up-to-date count

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the queries in `consumers/ksql.py`

#### Tips

* The KSQL CLI is the best place to build your queries. Try `ksql` in your workspace to enter the CLI.
* You can run this file on its own simply by running `python ksql.py`
* Made a mistake in table creation? `DROP TABLE <your_table>`. If the CLI asks you to terminate a running query, you can `TERMINATE <query_name>`


### Step 6: Create Kafka Consumers
With all of the data in Kafka, our final task is to consume the data in the web server that is going to serve the transit status pages to our commuters.

To accomplish this, you must complete the following tasks:

1. Complete the code in `consumers/consumer.py`
1. Complete the code in `consumers/models/line.py`
1. Complete the code in `consumers/models/weather.py`
1. Complete the code in `consumers/models/station.py`

## Running and Testing

To run the simulation, you must first start up the Kafka ecosystem in your
local machine by:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once docker-compose is ready, the following services will be available:

| Service | Host URL | Docker URL | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public Transit Status | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) | n/a | ||
| Landoop Kafka Connect UI | [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) | http://connect-ui:8084 |
| Landoop Kafka Topics UI | [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) | http://topics-ui:8085 |
| Landoop Schema Registry UI | [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086) | http://schema-registry-ui:8086 |
| Kafka | PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9093,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9094 | PLAINTEXT://kafka0:9092,PLAINTEXT://kafka1:9093,PLAINTEXT://kafka2:9094 |
| REST Proxy | [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/) | http://rest-proxy:8082/ |
| Schema Registry | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/ ) | http://schema-registry:8081/ |
| Kafka Connect | [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) | http://kafka-connect:8083 |
| KSQL | [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) | http://ksql:8088 |
| PostgreSQL | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cta` | `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/cta` | `cta_admin` | `chicago` |

If all the services started correctly, you should be able to see the following
list of topics:
```
__confluent.support.metrics
__consumer_offsets
_confluent-ksql-ksql_service_docker_command_topic
_schemas
connect-config
connect-offset
connect-status
```
after typing
```sh
docker exec broker kafka-topics --zookeeper zookeeper:2181 --list
```

### Running the Simulation

There are two pieces to the simulation, the `producer` and `consumer`. 

#### To run the `producer`:

1. `cd producers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python simulation.py`

Once the simulation is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.

#### To run the Faust Stream Processing Application:
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `faust -A faust_stream worker -l info`


#### To run the KSQL Creation Script:
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python ksql.py`

#### To run the `consumer`:

** NOTE **: Do not run the consumer until you have reached Step 6!
1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python server.py`
